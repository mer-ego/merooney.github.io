			    <p>This post warrants a disclaimer: I have never once considered myself a designer; I have only the smallest quantity of &quot;artistic taste&quot;. This is said so as to dispel any presumptuous airs that may stink up what I am about to say.</p>
<p>I have never had much occasion to think about visual design before this site.</p>
<p>In a previous post I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A webpage is a convenient, widely accessible canvas upon which to experiment with current design trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among those people who are nodes in my social acquaintance graph, much time is spent staring at information rendered in a web browser. A large portion of consumer-facing commerce already exists solely on the web. If compelled to interact with two objects that are functionally equivalent, but that differ in degree of visual appeal, a person will choose the more attractive. A lot of the content on the web that is fighting for pageviews is highly derivative of other content. Thus, the deciding factor for which brand wins is good design. This line of thinking is what makes design for the web the most competitive domain of design, and thus a lucrative market.</p>
<p>Now again, I don&#39;t consider myself a designer. However, after reading the paragraph I wrote above, I would be a fool to ignore design. <em>After all, I want all of my readers to fall in love with my personal brand; I am a pretty great deal</em>. I would also be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t a little excited to tinker with the appearance of this site. My previous dabblings in artistic pursuits have been engrossing.</p>
<p>But... a fear stirs within me!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have to think to hard to remember the many hours that snuck away as I tinkered with my text editor/console color schemes. Playing with shapes, lines, and colors has a strong seductive pull over me, as I suspect it does with most. I cannot write anything by hand unless I have gridded paper; the slightest vertical drift in my script will prompt a spontaneous flurry of erasure. That is why I am putting my foot down now and circumventing an addiction. <strong>This site will not turn into an overproduced OCD-tinged addiction</strong>. Please call me out if the site ever becomes visually egregious. Like I said, I haven&#39;t developed an eye for such things yet. I will strive for a clean and simple design, and I will only redesign once a year at most.</p>
