            <p>This post warrants a disclaimer: I have never once considered myself a designer; I have only the smallest quantity of &quot;artistic taste&quot;. This is said so as to dispel any presumptuous airs that may stink up what I am about to say.</p>
<p>I have never had much occasion to think about visual design before this site.</p>
<p>In a previous post I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A webpage is a convenient, widely accessible canvas upon which to experiment with current design trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among those people who are nodes in my social acquaintance graph, much time is spent staring at information rendered in a web browser. A large portion of consumer-facing commerce already exists solely on the web. If compelled to interact with two objects that are functionally equivalent, but that differ in degree of visual appeal, a person will choose the more attractive. A lot of the content on the web that is fighting for pageviews is highly derivative of other content. Thus, the deciding factor for which brand wins is good design. This line of thinking is what makes design for the web the most competitive domain of design, and thus a lucrative market.</p>
<p>Now again, I don&#39;t consider myself a designer. However, after reading the paragraph I wrote above, I would be a fool to ignore design. <em>After all, I want all of my readers to fall in love with my personal brand; I am a pretty great deal</em>. I would also be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t a little excited to tinker with the appearance of this site. My previous dabblings in artistic pursuits have been engrossing.</p>
<p>But... a fear stirs within me!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have to think to hard to remember the many hours that snuck away as I tinkered with my text editor/console color schemes. Playing with shapes, lines, and colors has a strong seductive pull over me, as I suspect it does with most. I cannot write anything by hand unless I have gridded paper; the slightest vertical drift in my script will prompt a spontaneous flurry of erasure. That is why I am putting my foot down now and circumventing an addiction. <strong>This site will not turn into an overproduced OCD-tinged addiction</strong>. Please call me out if the site ever becomes visually egregious. Like I said, I haven&#39;t developed an eye for such things yet. I will strive for a clean and simple design, and I will only redesign once a year at most.</p>

            <p>Why am I going through the trouble of establishing a personal website? I asked myself this question many times over as I perused listings of today&#39;s most popular static site generators. Despite the likelihood my current enthusiasm will shrivel, and the rate of updates will become a dribble, I just couldn&#39;t shake the compulsion. Upon closer examination, I perceive the following as my motivating reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My trade involves programming, and making a professional showcase online is expected of practitioners.</li>
<li>A webpage is a convenient, widely accessible canvas upon which to experiment with current design trends.</li>
<li>I like writing. By making my writing public, my vanity can be sated.</li>
<li>The act of maintaining and updating this site will keep me informed with trending web technologies.</li>
<li>Guilt over not posting enough content of value will steer me towards writing technical articles.</li>
<li>I need to grow my digital presence free of any closed platforms.</li>
<li>By writing such a weighty manifesto in my first post, I will hereafter be shamed into strict adherence.  </li>
</ul>
<p>As of this post, I am generating this site statically using <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">MetalSmith</a>. Since javascript will continue to be the runtime language of the browser, I figure I ought to achieve some level of proficiency with it. It made a lot of sense to use javascript for the site backend as well as the frontend. Truly a novel idea!</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> service for hosting because I can&#39;t be bothered to serve up my own HTML. Who has time to run their own HTTP servers and keep them patched these days?! I can&#39;t be expected to have to do my own &quot;DevOps&quot; these days. If I need to make this website more dynamic I will just shove more javascript into your browser tab, so look forward to that. I am writing the markdown for this post before I have even deployed this site, so I don&#39;t know what my frontend styling will look like. I don&#39;t want to incur too much technical debt, so I will suffer through writing my own CSS rather than use a massive framework. Full disclosure: I tried using Bootstrap, but since I had never written a CSS theme before, I produced a fragile abomination. I now realize Bootstrap and similar CSS &quot;solutions&quot; are overkill for a personal website. My sympathies go out to all those beginners who are tricked into believing they need several kB of pre-written CSS before they write a single line of their own.</p>
<p>If you are as excited as I am about watching how this blog develops a unique voice, I will be implementing an RSS/(atom?) feed even though I myself have never subscribed to an RSS feed. Let&#39;s subscribe together.</p>
